# ZDS dotfiles
These is my dotfile collection. It's a modest collection, I'm still very much learning how to configure linux, but my setup and skills are improving every day.

Major props to aliceriot for all the help she's given me while learning. Vimbootstrap has also been a huge help getting me started with sensible defaults in vim

.
